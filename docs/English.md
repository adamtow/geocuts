# Location Triggers for Cronios
Location Triggers works with Cronios, the shortcuts scheduler for iOS, to automatically run shortcuts or send text messages based on your current location.

You can also create new Location Triggers from the iOS Share Sheet in Maps and Contacts. 

As Cronios lets you automate your iOS device based on time, Location Triggers does the same for locations!

6. If you chose message, you can send to up to five recipients.

## Location Triggers
Location Triggers consist of the following components:

- **Enabled**: The on/off switch for the Location Trigger. 
- **Name**: The name of the Location Trigger. 
- **Location**: The location where the trigger is centered on. 
- **Trigger Radius**: The maximum distance from the location for the trigger to occur. The distance unit of miles or kilometers is specified from the Customize Shortcut‚Ä¶ page. 
- **Active Timeframe**: The times during the day when this Location Trigger is active. 
- **Active Days**: The days of the week on which the Location Trigger will work. 
- **Repeat Interval**: How long the Location Trigger must wait before being able to be triggered again at the same location. You can specify:
	- **Run Once**: Once the Location Trigger runs, it turns itself off. Use this for one time events. 
	- **Minutes**: The number of minutes you must wait before the Location Trigger becomes active again. 
	- **Hours**: The number of hours you must wait before the Location Trigger becomes active again. 
	- **Days**: The number of calendar days you must wait before the Location Trigger becomes active again. 
	- **No Delay**: Repeat the command as often as Location Triggers for Cronios is called by Cronios. 
- **Command**: The action performed when there is a location match. You can send a text message or run a [background-aware shortcut](#shortcuts). 
    - **Send a Text Message**
        - **Message**: the contents of the SMS or iMessage that will be sent when the Message command has been selected. 
        - **Recipient**: the recipient(s) of the text message when the Message command has been selected. You can specify up to 5 recipients. 
    - **Run a Shortcut**
        - **Shortcut**: the shortcut to run when the location trigger is successfully matched with the device‚Äôs current location. 
- **Success Notification**: Displays a banner notification when the Location Trigger‚Äôs command is run. Specify false to suppress the notification. 

## How It Works
When run by Cronios or manually Location Triggers takes the following steps:

1. Checks the global ON/OFF switch. If OFF, it exits. If ON, it continues to Step 2. 
2. Checks if the device is locked using the [Lock Detection technique from Cronios](http://cronios.com#lock-detection). If the device appears locked and Lock Detection is enabled in Settings, an audible prompt or banner notification with sound appears is presented to the user to unlock the device. If the device still appears to be locked after 10 seconds, exit. Otherwise, continue to Step 3. 
3. Notifies the user that an app switch is about to occur. 
4. Switches to the Shortcuts app. To retrieve the current location and send messages, Shortcuts must be the frontmost application. 
5. Retrieves the current location of the device. This may take several seconds. 
6. Iterates through all active and available Location Triggers and determines whether the current location lies within the radius of each trigger.
7. For each match, run the command assigned to the trigger: run a shortcut or send a text message. 
8. Exits and returns control back to Cronios or the user. 

## Balancing the Frequency of Checks
Because retrieving the device location and sending messages currently requires a switch back to the Shortcuts app, you should be careful how often you call Location Triggers for Cronios in Cronios itself. 

Importing the cron job lets you choose from check intervals of 5, 15, and 30 minutes. You can further adjust the schedule from within Cronios. 

## Exploring the GeoCuts Interface
When you open to the GeoCuts Home screen, you're presented with the following sections of information:

- **Enable/Disable Monitoring**: A global on/off switch for GeoCuts. If disabled, you will not be able to monitor your location triggers from Cronios or the GeoCuts Helper shortcut.
